[X] Comparison to Iterables
[X] Comparison to Promises
    - Advantages (Cancellable, represent sequence instead of single future)
    - Disadvantages (Subscriptions *usually* require cleanup)
    - Comparable (filter, map, join)
[X] Getting started
    - Installing (NPM, webpack) - Importing, importing operators
    - Installing (traditional)  - Also possible, no need to demonstrate?
[X] Observable concepts
    - Next, Error, Complete
    - Hot vs Cold
    - Others?
[#] Constructing observables
    - cold - Observable.of()
    - hot  - new Subject<T>()
    - Other producers?
[ ] A few "operators"
    - switchMap?
    - merge?
    - Documentation, how to find operators
[ ] switchMap demo
[ ] When do I need to clean up subscriptions?
    - "Internal" observables - garbage collector should deal?
    - "External" observables - make sure to clean up subscriptions?
    - Subscriptions also cleaned up automatically on Error or Complete
[ ] Techniques for managing subscriptions
[ ] Unit testing
    - Async tests
    - Hot/Cold observables can behave differently, makes mocking difficult

SWITCH TO SYSTEMJS?
